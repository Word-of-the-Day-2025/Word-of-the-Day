# Terms of Service (Discord Bot)

## Prohibited Use
The WOTD Discord bot's main purpose is for sending the Word of the Day to subscribers of the service. You may not:

- Charge money for access to receiving the Word of the Day (e.g., requiring users of a server to pay to unlock a WOTD channel)
- Attempt to break the bot with bugs; you may host your own bot for bug hunting from the code on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Word-of-the-Day-2025/Word-of-the-Day)
- Excessively spam the Discord bot (There are more efficient ways to slow down our servers)

## ToS & Privacy Policy Changes
If the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are going to be updated, subscribers will be made aware 30 days before the change with information on what has been updated. By staying subscribed, you acknowledge and accept the updated terms of service and/or privacy policy.
